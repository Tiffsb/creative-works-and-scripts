Outreachy is a volunteer organization under the Software Freedom Conservancy
that provides internships and mentoring in Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS). Outreachy coordination tasks include promotion, herding project
mentors, and a whole lot of data wrangling. This repository includes scripts I
create to help me with those tasks, updated artwork for promoting Outreachy,
and anything that's public and needs to be under revision control.
