## Photo release

File: Outreachy-photo-rights-release.pdf

This should be signed by all attendees of the celebration. This allows Outreachy and Conservancy to use the photos and videos we take during the celebration for promoting Outreachy.

If someone doesn't want to sign the photo and video release, or does not want to be photographed, they should be given a yellow lanyard. The photographer and other attendees should be instructed not to take pictures of attendees with yellow lanyards.

## Props

These props can be held by attendees while taking pictures. The props can be printed and taped to a stick. They can be held by attendees while they are taking photos with each other or by the Outreachy celebration banner.

The photo frame can be put on digital pictures shared on social media, like Instagram or Mastodon.
