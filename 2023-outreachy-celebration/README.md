## Photo release

File: Outreachy-photo-rights-release.pdf

This should be signed by all attendees of the celebration. This allows Outreachy and Conservancy to use the photos and videos we take during the celebration for promoting Outreachy.

If someone doesn't want to sign the photo and video release, or does not want to be photographed, they should be given a yellow lanyard. The photographer and other attendees should be instructed not to take pictures of attendees with yellow lanyards.

## Tote bag

The file contains both the front and back designs of the tote bag. 
The front design contains the Outreachy logo and a summary of what the program stands for: "Paid Remote Internship. 
The back design contains what we stand to achieve: "Supporting Diversity in Open Source and Open Science".

## Props

These props can be held by attendees while taking pictures. The props can be printed and taped to a stick. They can be held by attendees while they are taking photos with each other or by the Outreachy celebration banner.

The photo frame can be put on digital pictures shared on social media, like Instagram or Mastodon.

## Stickers

There are two stickers that we will be using for the event. It is recommended to purchase die-cut stickers from Sticker Robot, or your local sticker vendor.

The first sticker is the Outreachy logo. If you modify this design, please make sure to include the "stairs". The stairs represent Outreachy helping interns "level up" their skills and take the next steps in their career.

The sticker with animal on it is a "manatee mentoring their mentee". It represents Outreachy mentors working with their interns.
