## Photo release

File: Outreachy-photo-rights-release.pdf

All attendees of the celebration should sign this. This allows Outreachy and Conservancy to use the photos and videos we take during the celebration to promote Outreachy.

If someone doesn't want to sign the photo and video release or does not want to be photographed, they should be given a yellow lanyard. The photographer and other attendees should be instructed not to take pictures of attendees with yellow lanyards.

## Tote bag

The file contains both the front and back designs of the tote bag. 
The front design contains the Outreachy logo and a summary of what the program stands for: "Paid Remote Internship. 
The back design contains what we stand to achieve: "Supporting Diversity in Open Source and Open Science."

## Travel Bottle

There are two different designs for the bottles. 

The first design has an Outreachy logo, a summary of what the program stands for: "Paid Remote Internship, and what we stand to achieve: "Supporting Diversity in Open Source and Open Science."

The second design has a sticker with animals on it is a "manatee mentoring their mentee." It represents Outreachy mentors working with their interns.

## Props

These props can be held by attendees while taking pictures. The props can be printed and taped to a stick. Attendees can hold them while taking photos with each other or by the Outreachy celebration banner.

The photo frame can be put on digital social media pictures like Instagram or Mastodon.

## Stickers

There are two stickers that we will be using for the event. Purchasing die-cut stickers from Sticker Robot or your local sticker vendor is recommended.

The first sticker is the Outreachy logo. If you modify this design, please include the "stairs." The stairs represent Outreachy helping interns "level up" their skills and take the next steps in their careers.

The sticker with animals on it is a "manatee mentoring their mentee." It represents Outreachy mentors working with their interns.
