# T-shirt design

We recommend using these t-shirts design files:
 - [front](https://github.com/outreachy/creative-works-and-scripts/blob/master/2023-outreachy-celebration/t-shirt/2023-final-shirt-design-front.svg)
 - [back](https://github.com/outreachy/creative-works-and-scripts/blob/master/2023-outreachy-celebration/t-shirt/2023-final-shirt-design-back.svg))

If your t-shirt printer allows it, we suggest having a print on one arm of the t-shirt. The arm print can include your event location's country shape and country flag, with the words 1,000 Outreachy intern celebration. Design files:

(Note: the USA t-shirt will not include a location arm print because the screen printer cannot do arm prints.)
