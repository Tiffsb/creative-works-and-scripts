Get an initial configuration from wherever you installed MoinMoin:

    cp -a $MOIN_PREFIX/share/moin/{config/wikiconfig.py,data,underlay} .

Extract the exported tarball into `data/pages/`.

Use MoinMoin to export a pile of HTML:

    moin --config-dir=. export dump --target-dir=html

Convert the HTML to Markdown, but clean up some weird MoinMoin-specific
things first. If you want a different format than Markdown, replace the
".md" extension with an appropriate one from the list supported by
Pandoc.

    for f in html/*.html; do pandoc --filter ./extract-contents.py -o "$(basename "$f" .html)".md "$f"; done
