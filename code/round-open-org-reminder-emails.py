Subject: {project} participation in Outreachy?

Hi {names},

The Outreachy program is looking for organizations to participate in
round 13.  Do you think {project} would be willing to participate again?
The round will open on September 12, and the sooner {project} is listed,
the more likely you'll get strong applicants.
