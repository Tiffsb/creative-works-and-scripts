" By supporting the Outreachy internships, participating companies are working upstream and improving the diversity of the FOSS community. In total, of 322 past Outreachy participants, 48 had full-session talks at FOSS conferences and 43 found employment or contract work with sponsoring organizations. Three past participants have organized local technology initiatives: Chicagoans Hacking on GNOME, the Nairobi Dev School, and Women in Free Software - India. Many find the program life-changing, as it introduces them to something they become passionate about and opens the door to new opportunities.
